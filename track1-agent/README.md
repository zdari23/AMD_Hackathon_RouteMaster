# Track 1: Hybrid Token-Efficient Routing Agent

This repository contains our submission for the **AMD Developer Hackathon: ACT II (Track 1)**. 

Our agent is a highly optimized hybrid router designed to absolutely minimize Fireworks API token usage. It achieves this through zero-token local deterministic solvers for math/logic, aggressive token starvation (disabling reasoning tokens & stripping tags), and a strict cross-tier fallback mechanism.

## Prerequisites

- Docker installed
- A valid Fireworks AI API Key

## Setup & Usage Instructions

This project is fully containerized. To run the evaluation agent and see the routing logic in action, follow these steps:

### 1. Build the Docker Image

Run the following command in the root directory to build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t track1-agent .
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Fireworks API key:

```env
FIREWORKS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

*(Optional: You can also specify the allowed models by adding `ALLOWED_MODELS` to your `.env` file.)*

### 3. Run the Container

Run the container using the `.env` file you just created:

```bash
docker run --env-file .env track1-agent
```

The container will automatically execute `eval_agent.py`, which will process the sample dataset, demonstrate the zero-token local solvers, and output the total Fireworks API tokens saved!

## Streamlit demo deployment

The demo is deployed separately from the hackathon Docker image. Streamlit
Community Cloud runs `demo_app.py` directly from this GitHub repository and
installs the packages in `requirements.txt`.

1. Open [Streamlit Community Cloud](https://share.streamlit.io/) and create an app.
2. Select this repository, the `main` branch, and `demo_app.py` as the entrypoint.
3. In **Advanced settings**, choose Python 3.11 or newer and add these secrets:

```toml
FIREWORKS_API_KEY = "your_api_key_here"
MODEL = "accounts/fireworks/models/kimi-k2p6"
```

`MODEL` is optional because the app defaults to
`accounts/fireworks/models/kimi-k2p6`. The only required secret is
`FIREWORKS_API_KEY`. If the deployment environment supplies `ALLOWED_MODELS`,
the app uses the Kimi entry from that list, matching `agent.py`.

Do not commit `.env` or `.streamlit/secrets.toml`. If the optional fine-tuned
DistilBERT checkpoint is unavailable, the demo automatically uses the project's
deterministic local router and identifies that backend in the UI.
